# Currently Abandoned

This is my react based implementation for plaing chess in a browser. It was intended to be for testing the chess engine i wanted to write however issues with time and project scope meant it never got finished. <br />

Its not great, really clunky and heavy but its does work. If i were to pick this project up again i would definetly completly redo this part of it.<br />

All rules except for checkmate are covered. <br />
